idk what programming language im going to use lmao

to-do list and resources ig: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porkchop_plot

1st do point to point transfers, later take into account planetary flybys and gravitational slingshots
if u want to
cuz like
that would be more math
how much more idk but
it would definitely be interesting and really cool to implement for sure
hm.

also definitely consider everything to be circular and coplanar at first because like
blehh

so 
circles & hohmann transfers 
-> ellipses
-> slingshots :fear: (could just do 1???? customizable maybe??? hmm)
-> inclination (if i have like 50 extra hours)
