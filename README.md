# B4-AP-Comp-Sci-Individual-Project


This project will be a transfer window calculator. Using a simple model solar system, the program will be able to find optimal transfer times and trajectories between planets in order to optimize time and resources. This will be displayed in a porkchop plot, showing how much time and delta-v (fuel) will be needed with respect to time (for explanation, time changed the possible trajectories and gravitational slingshots that will be possible).

(ill come up with a cooler name for this later probably :P)

yeah
